Problems encountered:
	1. The Eclipse and Visual Studio versions of the p1.cpp that I tried to use were incombatible  		with the general.asu.edu server's compiler. To solve this problem I knew I had two choices:
	edit it inside the server using vim, or use a Unix OS to fix the problems. I used the latter.
	2. The clock. It worked fine with Eclipse, Visual Studio, and on gedit (Ubuntu 15.04) with up 		to date gcc/g++ compiler. The problem with it is that the time it shows on my Linux machine is 		accurate to 3 decimal places. However the general.asu.edu server always rounds it to the 	 nearest whole number. Which doesn't make sense to me because I used floats to calculate my 		time.
	
Bugs: 
	The clock problem was the only one that could not get resolved, I didn't test it enough but
	I can only assume that the server is rounding to the nearest whole number. Since InsertionSort
	runs fast, it rounds down to 0 everytime.
